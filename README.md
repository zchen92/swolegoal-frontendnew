# SwoleGoals

## Concept

SwoleGoals is a full-CRUD application designed to help task-oriented users achieve their desired fitness goals. The idea was inspired by my inability to focus on fitness goals, often times forgetting the goals I set out to accomplish just the day prior. The application allows the user to create a secure account, and enters the day and the fitness goal for the day (i.e Mondays are my leg days). Within each day, they can enter specific activities they want to complete, along with a description of the activity, such as the number of sets or repetitions, duration of activity, or links to tutorials they want to refer to. The application is built using a one-t-many relationship with SQL and Ruby on Rails on the backend, React on the frontend, and basic CSS and Bootstrap for the final design. Simple as that. Let's get swole!

## Technologies used
1. Ruby on Rails
2. React
3. SQL and PostgreSQL
4. JSX
5. Node.js
6. Bootstrap and CSS
7. HTML

### Step 4 - Deploy with Heroku

## Future Goals:

### Strike-through
I wanted the user to be able to click on each goal for the day and toggle it to strike-through once the activity is created. I was able to do this with CSS but not able to set the state to remember which goals were already crossed out.

### User Registration
The user is able to create a log in name and password but nothing else at the moment. I would like to add additional user information in the future to create a full profile, including their fitness goal and the ability to track the goal (perhaps a chart?) in the future in order to make the experience more personalized. I'd also like to make the "remember me" functional in the future.

### Design 
There is still a lot of work that needs to be done with the overall design of the application to make it look more user friendly and professional. This includes adding in carousel of photos in the navbar, enhanced UX design. 

### Additional features
I want to add in additional pages of outside resources that provide sample exercises for the users to be able to pull and add to their own goal list.

### Mobile
This application would ideally be employable through mobile applications. I want to learn React Native in the future to make this possible. However, in the meantime, I was able to make the application partially responsive using Bootstrap/CSS.
